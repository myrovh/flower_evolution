To select a flower to merge type the number displayed below it and press enter. Select a second flower in the same manner. Then press 'm' to combine the flowers. A new set of random flowers can be generated by pressing the 'r' key.
Values inputted into the rng still need adjustment.
Use Cmake to build this program. CMakeLists.txt is provided. If the operating system you are compiling on does not have clang installed remove the line that defines CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER it will default back to g++.
